# PyTorch-Medtech-Diagnostic-Algorithm---Basic-Framework
Medtech Diagnostic Algorithm Using PyTorch
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for medical diagnostic purposes. The project focuses on analyzing CT medical images to identify and predict certain medical conditions. It demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in the field of medical imaging and healthcare technology.

Dataset
The project utilizes the "CT Medical Images" dataset from Kaggle, which comprises CT scans of cancer patients. This dataset is instrumental in examining trends in CT image data, focusing on aspects like contrast, modality, and patient age. More details about the dataset can be found here: CT Medical Images on Kaggle.

Model
The core of this project is a CNN model built using PyTorch. The model is structured to process CT images, extract relevant features, and classify them into predefined categories based on medical conditions. The model's architecture, training, and evaluation are detailed in the Jupyter notebooks included in this repository.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Torchvision
