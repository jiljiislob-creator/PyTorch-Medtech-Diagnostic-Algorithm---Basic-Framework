# PyTorch Medtech Diagnostic Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for the purpose of medical diagnostics. It focuses on analyzing CT medical images to detect and predict medical conditions, showcasing the application of deep learning in medical imaging.

## Dataset
The "CT Medical Images" dataset from Kaggle is used, featuring CT scans of cancer patients. This dataset aids in examining CT image data trends. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/siim-medical-images)

## Model
A CNN model, built with PyTorch, processes CT images to classify them into categories based on medical conditions. The model's architecture, training, and evaluation processes are detailed in the included Jupyter notebook.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
